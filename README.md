About
With the growing demand for renewable energy due to rapid urbanization, industrial expansion, and climate change, optimizing energy production and efficiency is crucial. This project applies Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to enhance energy forecasting, improve storage solutions, and optimize grid distribution for solar and wind energy systems.

Data-Overview
The dataset was obtained from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB), specifically for the African region.
It provides essential solar and weather parameters needed for analyzing and optimizing solar and wind energy generation.

Key Attributes in the Dataset
Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI): Measures total solar radiation received on a horizontal     surface (sum of direct and diffuse radiation)
Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI): Measures solar radiation received perpendicular to the sunâ€™s rays, critical for solar panel efficiency.
Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI): Measures scattered solar radiation received on a horizontal surface, important in cloudy conditions
